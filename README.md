Game Design Document: Magical Elevator üõó
1. üí° Game Concept
High Concept: A surreal, physics-based survival game set entirely on a single elevator platform. Players must stay on the elevator as it ascends through a mystical tower, but each floor introduces a new magical mutation that tilts, rotates, shrinks, or otherwise alters the platform.
Genre: 3D Platformer, Survival
Target Audience: Players who enjoy quirky, physics-based challenges and games with surprising, unpredictable elements.
2. ‚öôÔ∏è Gameplay Mechanics
Core Loop:
Ride Elevator: The player stands on a simple platform elevator that is constantly ascending.
Survive Challenges: At each "floor," a random magical effect is applied to the elevator platform for a short duration (e.g., it tilts 45 degrees, it starts spinning, parts of the floor disappear).
Balance: The player must constantly move and jump to maintain their balance and stay on the platform.
Objective:
Survive the ascent to the top floor of the tower.
Hazards & Obstacles:
The only hazard is falling off the elevator. The challenge comes entirely from the unpredictable changes to the platform itself.

3. üé® Art and Visuals
Art Style: A mystical, low-poly 3D style. The elevator and character are simple, but the background and lighting effects are dramatic and magical.
Concept Art:
Character: A simple, agile character, perhaps a wizard's apprentice or a stone golem.
Environment: The elevator ascends through a vast, abstract, magical space. The background changes with each floor, showing swirling nebulas, giant crystals, or ancient runes.
UI Mockup: A simple UI element at the top shows the current floor number and the destination floor.
4. üéµ Sound and Music
Music: An enchanting, orchestral soundtrack that builds in intensity and drama as the elevator climbs higher.
Sound Effects:
Elevator: A constant, low humming and creaking of stone.
Mutation: A magical "chime" or "zap" signals a new floor challenge is starting.
Fall: A long, fading scream or whoosh.
5. ‚ú® Polish Goals
Mystical Glow: The elevator emits a soft, magical glow.
Creak SFX: The platform makes realistic creaking sounds as it tilts.
Floor Countdown UI: A clear indicator of how many floors are left.
Dramatic Lighting: The lighting color and direction change with each floor's theme.
